# The Document Pipeline

> **Intent Classification**: GENERIC INTENT (Universal / Parameterized Blueprint)
## Understanding a document whatever its condition, source and orientation

> **Motto**: *"A page is not a file. A scan is not text. And a badly photocopied document is not safe data — that has to be stated, not guessed."*

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Native text and visual readings can omit different values. Uneven scans and incorrect orientation can turn uncertain input into plausible but wrong output. The pipeline preserves these uncertainties and confronts independent readings of the same page; measured accuracy requires ground truth.

---

## 2. THE PAGE IS THE UNIT OF WORK

A PDF is **potentially multi-page**, and pages do not resemble one another:

| Kind of page | What handles it |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pure text** | native extraction (the PDF's text layer) |
| **Pure image** (scan, photo) | deskew → OCR → vision |
| **Both** | native extraction **and** OCR/vision, then reconciliation |

Processing a document "as a whole" amounts to applying the first page's method to all the others. That is the original mistake.

---

## 3. THE CANONICAL ORDER OF PROCESSING

This order is not advisory: **each stage depends on the one before it**. Straightening after reading is pointless; running the triple reading before straightening degrades all three witnesses at once.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    intake["<b>STEP 0 — INTAKE</b><br/><i>the document arrives, with its source and its depositor</i>"]

    intake -->|PDF| split
    intake -->|"IMAGE only<br/>jpg, png, scan, photo, heic"| orient
    intake -->|"TEXT only<br/>txt, csv, text-only documents…"| arbitrate

    split["<b>STEP 1 — SPLIT INTO PAGES</b><br/>for each page: the page image,<br/>and the native text layer if present"]
    orient["<b>STEP 2 — ORIENTATION AND DESKEW</b><br/>analyse reading direction,<br/>rotate 0/90/180/270, deskew"]
    legible["<b>STEP 3 — LEGIBILITY MEASUREMENT</b><br/><i>score stored on the page</i>"]
    triple["<b>STEP 4 — TRIPLE READING</b><br/>native text · OCR · vision"]
    arbitrate["<b>STEP 5 — ARBITRATION</b><br/>the arbiter agent produces the result,<br/><i>or refuses if the quality is not there</i>"]
    recognise["<b>STEP 6 — TYPE RECOGNITION</b>"]
    handler["<b>STEP 7 — BUSINESS HANDLER</b><br/>filing and database write"]

    split --> orient --> legible --> triple --> arbitrate --> recognise --> handler

    classDef s fill:#0d1117,stroke:#3fb950,color:#e6edf3
    classDef e fill:#161b22,stroke:#58a6ff,color:#e6edf3
    class split,orient,legible,triple,arbitrate,recognise,handler s
    class intake e
```

A lone image enters at **step 2**, as a one-page document. Its absent native-text witness is recorded as absent; OCR and vision do not pretend to be three witnesses. A text file enters at
**step 5**, with a single witness instead of three — and the arbiter is told so,
rather than left to infer it from silence.

A mixed-content office document is inspected and decomposed according to its actual content. Only genuinely text-only inputs bypass image stages; a file extension alone does not establish that condition.

### The stages in detail

| Step | What happens | Why exactly here |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Document intake, with its source and its depositor | Identity must be captured at the door; it will be needed for filing (§9) |
| **1** | **PDF only**: split into pages. For each page we produce **the page image** *and* **the native text layer when available** | Both are produced systematically, not as an either/or: the text layer may exist on one page and not on the next |
| **2** | **Analyse the image's reading direction**, then rotate and deskew | Must precede any reading. A skewed page degrades OCR; an upside-down page gives a false result, not a mediocre one |
| **3** | Measure the legibility of the straightened page | After straightening, otherwise you measure the quality of a badly oriented image |
| **4** | **Triple reading**: native text layer, OCR of the image, vision agent | All three start from the **same, already straight page**, otherwise they are not describing the same object |
| **5** | **Arbitration**: the agent compares the three and produces the result, or refuses | Cannot exist before all three readings |
| **6** | Document type recognition | Rests on the arbitrated result, not on any single witness |
| **7** | Business handler: filing in the GED, writing to the database | The type determines which handler, and the depositor from step 0 determines where |

### The three entry points

This is the part not to miss:

* **PDF** → enters at **step 1**. It is the only type that goes through the page split.
* **A lone image** (photo of an invoice, scan of an ID card, screenshot) → **has no pages to split**. It enters **directly at step 2**, handled as a one-page document. From there it gets exactly the same journey: deskew, legibility, triple reading, arbitration.
* **Text only** (txt, csv, text-only documents…) → no image, therefore no deskew, no OCR, no vision. It enters at **step 5** with **a single witness**, and the result says so: confidence cannot lean on a confrontation that never took place.

> **Invariant**: a document never enters the pipeline "at the beginning" on principle. It enters **at the stage matching its nature**, and leaves by the same path as every other. That is what will let us add a video, audio or email source tomorrow without rewriting the existing stages.

---

## 4. THREE WITNESSES, AND AN ARBITER AGENT THAT PRODUCES THE RESULT

This is the heart of the doctrine, and the separation between independent witnesses and a reasoned result.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    page["<b>PAGE STRAIGHTENED, MEASURED</b>"]

    native["Native extraction<br/><i>raw text layer</i>"]
    ocr["OCR of the image<br/><i>dedicated engine</i>"]
    vision["Vision agent<br/><i>read by a model</i>"]

    arbiter["<b>ARBITER AGENT</b><br/>compares the three versions<br/>and produces the result"]
    out["final fields + confidence + disagreements"]

    page --> native --> arbiter
    page --> ocr --> arbiter
    page --> vision --> arbiter
    arbiter --> out

    classDef p fill:#0d1117,stroke:#3fb950,color:#e6edf3
    classDef w fill:#161b22,stroke:#58a6ff,color:#e6edf3
    class page,arbiter,out p
    class native,ocr,vision w
```

### This is not a vote, nor a mechanical merge

The first three are **witnesses**: they describe the same page by different means. None of them delivers the result.

A **fourth agent** receives the three versions, confronts them, settles the discrepancies, and **it is that agent which produces the final result**. It sees what no single witness can see: that OCR read `8` where vision read `B`, that an amount in the native text does not match the one read off the image, that a line exists in two witnesses and not in the third.

> Adequate visual quality is necessary, not a guarantee of accuracy. Qualify results against known truth and preserve uncertainty.

That is why reconciliation is not merge code but a **capability class in its own right** (`document-arbiter`, §11): settling between three divergent readings requires understanding the document, not comparing strings.

### And when quality is not there

The arbiter is also the one who states that it **cannot settle**: witnesses too divergent, page too degraded, text illegible.

In that case the pipeline does not deliver a poor-quality result — it **refuses, and says so**:

* the document is marked **unusable as it stands**, naming the offending page or pages;
* **the requester is told explicitly**: *"this document is too degraded for reliable analysis"*;
* the reason travels all the way to the interface, rather than being buried in a log.

A reasoned refusal is a good result. A field filled by guesswork off an illegible page is the worst possible result, because nothing downstream can tell it apart from correct data any more.

---

## 5. GEOMETRY BEFORE READING

Nothing is analysed before the page has been put straight.

1. **Orientation** — detect 0°/90°/180°/270° and rotate. The vision agent helps here: it can say which way up a page reads.
2. **Deskew** — correct the tilt of a crooked scan, which degrades OCR badly.
3. **The applied orientation is recorded** in the result: it must be possible to know that a page was rotated by 180°.

---

## 6. THE LEGIBILITY INDICATOR

Every page carries a **stored legibility score**, computed before extraction — contrast, sharpness, noise, density of recognised characters.

It is not decoration:

* below a threshold, the document is marked **doubtful** and does not silently feed a database;
* it makes it possible to tell the user *"this scan is too faint, redo it"* instead of handing them wrong figures;
* it explains after the fact why an extraction failed.

> A bad photocopy is an **input known to be bad**. The worst case is not failure; it is the wrong value wearing a confident face.

---

## 7. RECOGNISE THE TYPE, THEN ACT — TWO DISTINCT STEPS

The pipeline **identifies** what the document is. A **declared handler** decides what is done with it. The two never mix: adding a document type must never force a change to the pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    chain["document → pages → witnesses → <b>TYPE RECOGNISED</b> → declared handler → effects"]

    receipt["<b>restaurant receipt</b><br/>amount, date, establishment,<br/>purpose if any"]
    bank["<b>bank statement</b><br/>transactions line by line,<br/>balance"]
    identity["<b>identity document</b><br/>name, dates, number,<br/>validity"]

    chain --> receipt
    chain --> bank
    chain --> identity

    classDef c fill:#0d1117,stroke:#3fb950,color:#e6edf3
    classDef t fill:#161b22,stroke:#58a6ff,color:#e6edf3
    class chain c
    class receipt,bank,identity t
```

### The restaurant receipt, followed through end to end

This is the case that shows why the depositor must travel with the document:

1. An **authenticated** employee scans their restaurant receipt.
2. The pipeline recognises the type "restaurant receipt".
3. It extracts the **amount**, the **date**, the **establishment**, and the **purpose** if stated.
4. The metadata carries **who scanned it** — identity is known, since the person was authenticated.
5. The handler files the receipt **in that person's folder** in the GED.
6. And it writes the row to the database: date, cost, establishment, purpose, depositor.

None of this is possible if the depositor's identity was lost along the way. Hence the invariant: **the depositor travels with the document**, from intake through to filing.

---

## 8. DESIGN IT OPEN

The pipeline does not belong to the GED. The GED is just one entry point among several.

| Source | Nature |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GED upload** | a human drops a file |
| **Email attachments** | intended from now on — analysing what lands in a mailbox |
| **Business messaging** (WhatsApp Pro and the like) | a client sends a photo of a document |
| **API / partner** | a third-party system pushes documents |

All of them go through **the same intake contract**: document, source, depositor, expected type if any. Wiring a new source must be configuration, never a variant of the pipeline.

> This list is not exhaustive — it is here as a reminder that the design must stay open, because input sources are going to multiply.

---

## 9. MULTIPLEXING

Processing is **parallel by construction**, at two levels: several documents at once, and several pages of the same document at once.

Design consequences, to be honoured from the first line of code:

* no stage assumes it is alone or that jobs/pages arrive in sequence; each page still follows the mandatory stage dependencies;
* state lives in the job, never in a module variable;
* a document's pages are reassembled by their number, not by their arrival order;
* the number of workers is a parameter, not a constant.

**Why this is structural**: document processing must not block navigation or other jobs. Measure responsiveness and concurrency on the actual implementation, with realistic large inputs.

---

## 10. THE PIPELINE TALKS TO THE INTERFACE WHILE IT WORKS

A pipeline that only answers at the end is unusable in a web page. A user uploading a 40-page statement must **see** what is happening, not wait in front of a frozen screen.

Each stage emits an event on a channel identified by the job, which the agent's page consumes live — with no repeated polling:

```
job received ──▶ document opened (12 pages)
             ──▶ page 1: deskewed 90°, legibility 0.91, native text
             ──▶ page 2: scan, OCR + vision, legibility 0.42 ⚠
             ──▶ page 3: …
             ──▶ type recognised: bank statement
             ──▶ 47 transactions extracted, 2 at low confidence
             ──▶ filed under /ged/accounting/2026-08/
```

What the interface must be able to do with it:

* open a **progress modal** and show advancement page by page;
* flag a page below the legibility threshold **immediately**, without waiting for the other 40;
* display extracted fields as they come, with their confidence;
* hand control back at once: the upload answers, the analysis narrates itself afterwards.

**Failure travels on the same channel.** An illegible page, an unavailable model, an unrecognised type: the watcher learns of it the moment it happens, at the stage where it happens. Nothing is discovered in a log after the fact.

> This is also what makes multiplexing visible: several documents advance in parallel, and the agent's page shows it — instead of a progress bar that lies about what is actually going on.

---

## 11. STATE LIVES IN THE DATABASE — THE STREAM IS ONLY AN ACCELERATOR

The question came up: should state be stored in a database so another agent can find out about work in progress on its own? **Yes, and it is not optional.** Here is why, and what it changes.

### An event stream is ephemeral by nature

If nobody is listening when the event goes past, it is lost. And yet:

* the agent's page can be reloaded mid-processing;
* a supervisor may want to know what happened **ten minutes ago**;
* a second agent may arrive **after** the work started;
* and a 40-page job outlives the tab that launched it.

A stream answers none of these cases. A database does.

### Division of roles

| | Role | Nature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | **source of truth** for state — where each document, each page, each extracted field stands | durable, queryable by authorized consumers |
| **Event stream** | **notification** of a state change, for real-time display | volatile, an interface convenience |

**The order is mandatory**: write the state, **then** emit the event. Never the reverse. An event emitted before the write describes a state nobody will be able to find.

Direct consequence: the stream becomes **replaceable**. An interface that misses it can always rebuild the situation by querying the database. That is what makes the whole thing robust rather than pretty.

### What it unlocks, beyond display

* **An agent informs itself.** *"Where is the batch uploaded this morning?"*, *"which documents are at low confidence?"*, *"what is waiting on a human?"* — without depending on who happened to be connected.
* **Rule 27 becomes applicable.** Counting attempts, deciding that `maxHealingAttempts` has been reached, marking `DEGRADED`: none of that can be counted in a stream.
* **Rule 23 too.** A supervisor diagnosing a stuck pipeline reads its state **from the outside, cold**. That is exactly the observed state of the reconciliation engine.
* **Recovery after restart.** A container coming back up knows which documents were in flight and how far they got.

### Where, concretely

In the **pipeline Podman's own private MariaDB** (Rule 26), never in an universe-wide or Queue database. The pipeline may consume work through `@shaper/pkg-queue`, but Queue retains its own separate database; typed events connect the functions without sharing storage.

> **Invariant**: everything a human can see in the modal, an agent must be able to obtain by querying the database. If a piece of information exists only in the stream, it does not exist.

---

## 12. THE PIPELINE EMBEDS NO MODEL: IT CALLS AGENTS

The pipeline orchestrates, it does not reason. It needs **access to agents** whose job that is:

| Capability class | The agent's mission | What it receives | What it returns |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`document-text`** | understand a document's text — spot entities, amounts, dates, the type | the page's text (native or OCR) and the document's context | structured fields, each with its confidence |
| **`document-vision`** | read a page as an image — layout, tables, stamps, reading direction | the image of the straightened page | text read, structure perceived, orientation observed |
| **`document-arbiter`** | **produce the final result** by confronting the three readings of the same page | native text, OCR output, vision output, and the legibility score | final fields, per-field confidence, disagreements observed, or a reasoned refusal |

**The mapping to a real engine is declared in `manifest.json` (Rule 21), never in the pipeline.** Whether the `document-text` class is served by a local model, an OpenCode bridge or a remote API does not change a line of pipeline code. That is what allows changing provider without touching the doctrine — and it is what protects the sovereignty promise: the day a local model suffices, we swap the mapping.

### Three design consequences

1. **Two agent roles, never to be confused.** `document-text` and `document-vision` are **witnesses**: their output enters the confrontation on the same footing as OCR and native extraction, and neither of them decides a value alone. `document-arbiter` is the **arbiter**: it is the only one that delivers the result. Merging those two roles — letting a witness produce the result directly — means returning to the old failure rate.
2. **An unavailable agent is a state, not a crash.** If `document-vision` does not answer, the page is processed with the remaining witnesses and **the result says a witness is missing** — confidence drops accordingly. We never pass two witnesses off as three.
3. **A slow agent does not immobilise the pipeline.** Calls are asynchronous, the job keeps advancing on the other pages, and the state in the database reflects the wait.

> This is Rule 21 applied to documents: the pipeline declares **what it needs** — understand a text, read an image — and the base decides **who does it**.

---

## 13. LOG FIRST, THEN MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS BY DOCUMENT TYPE

Every stage records durable structured audit, with a JSONL representation (Rules 0A and 26): duration, witnesses available, legibility score, disagreements observed, the arbiter's decision, any refusal and its reason. That is the raw material.

But the useful question is not *"what happened"*, it is **"does it work, at what rate, and on which document type"**. The target table:

| Document type | Processed | Arbitrated without disagreement | Low confidence | Refused (quality) | **Verified accuracy** |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Supplier invoice | 1,240 | 94% | 4% | 2% | ? |
| Bank statement | 310 | 89% | 8% | 3% | ? |
| Identity document | 87 | 97% | 1% | 2% | ? |

### The warning that matters

The first four columns compute themselves from the logs. **The last one does not.** Confidence is the system's opinion of itself: an arbiter can be certain and wrong. An accuracy rate is only obtained by comparing against a **known truth**.

Hence the invariant: **every human correction of an extracted field is recorded as reference truth.** Someone fixes a misread amount? That pair *(what the pipeline said, what was actually right)* becomes a row in the evaluation set. The corpus builds itself through use, with no annotation campaign.

That is what makes it possible to answer for real: *"on electricity bills, 98%; on scanned statements, 76%"* — and to know whether a new version of the arbiter improved things or made them worse.

---

## 14. AUTOMATIC CATEGORIES AND TAGS

Type recognition (§7) produces a **category**; analysis produces **tags**. Both are applied automatically, with no intervention.

* **Category** — what the document is: *till receipt*, *electricity bill*, *bank statement*, *identity document*, *restaurant receipt*. A closed, governed vocabulary.
* **Tags** — what the document says: the supplier (*Cursor AI*, *EDF*), the period, the arrival channel (*email*, *upload*, *messaging*), the depositor. An open vocabulary, enriched through use.

### The trap to avoid from the start

An ungoverned open vocabulary drifts within weeks: *invoice*, *Invoice*, *elec invoice*, *electricity*, *EDF* become five distinct tags for one reality, and every filter becomes wrong.

So: **every proposed tag goes through normalisation** (case, accents, singular form, known synonyms) before being applied. A new category, by contrast, is **proposed to the human** and not created outright — the one place where automation stops, because a category commands a business handler.

---

## 15. PROCESSING STATE: WHO HAS ALREADY DONE WHAT

A document is not "processed" or "unprocessed". It is processed **by whom**, and **how far**. That is what lets external processes plug in without treading on each other or redoing the work.

Every document therefore carries, in the database:

| Marker | The question it answers |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pipelineState` | where understanding stands: received, in progress, arbitrated, refused |
| `pipelineVersion` | **which version of the pipeline** produced this result — without it you can neither explain a regression nor replay identically |
| `handlers[]` | which business handlers acted, and when — one per row, never a single global boolean |
| `externalProcess[]` | which **external** processes took the document on, and with what outcome |
| `contentHash` | a fingerprint of the content, to recognise a document **already seen** |

### Why a log and not a flag

A "processed" boolean does not survive reality: the same document can be filed by one handler, exported by another, then picked up by an external accounting process. Each must be able to know **what has already been done** without assuming it is alone.

### The duplicate, a concrete and frequent case

The same document arrives twice — a forwarded email, a rescan, a client resending their document. Without `contentHash` you get two filings and **two rows in the accounts**. With it, the pipeline recognizes the document and records the new arrival against the existing one. It reuses compatible existing processing; an explicitly requested reprocessing records the new pipeline version without repeating completed business effects.

> It is this pair — **processing state + fingerprint** — that turns the pipeline into a business tool: several processes, human and automatic, work on the same document flow without duplicating or overwriting each other.

---

## 16. WHAT IS FORBIDDEN

* Choosing one witness **instead of** another rather than confronting them.
* Analysing a page **before** straightening it.
* Delivering a value **without** its provenance and its confidence.
* Writing data to the database from a page **below the legibility threshold** without flagging it.
* Coding business behaviour **inside** the pipeline rather than in a declared handler.
* Inventing a missing value. An empty field with its reason beats a plausible number (Rule 0G).
* Emitting an event **before** writing the corresponding state.
* Letting a piece of information exist only in the real-time stream.
* Hardcoding a model or a provider in the pipeline instead of calling a capability class.
* Presenting a result as complete when a witness was unavailable.
* Letting a witness produce the final result directly, bypassing the arbiter.
* Returning a result on a page of insufficient quality, instead of refusing and telling the requester.
* Announcing an accuracy rate computed from the system's confidence rather than from a known truth.
* Creating a new category without human validation, or applying a tag without normalising it.
* Reducing processing state to a boolean, or processing a document without checking its fingerprint.

The [local rules](../../RULES.md), [cognition contract](../architecture/COGNITION.md), [Queue](../contracts/queue.md) and [common action continuity](../intents/cognition-bridge.md) govern this pipeline. The tabulated volumes and percentages above are illustrative reporting formats, not observed qualification.
